# Pre-Processing Steps of the Mammography Images

The CBIS-DDSM dataset is available at https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cbis-ddsm/.

The CSAW dataset is available at https://snd.se/en/catalogue/dataset/2021-204-1 .

The Pre-Processing of the images should focus on: 
- Paring the MLO and CC projections
- Normalize and Resize to 256x256 pixels
- Eliminate any noise with the images

The example of the script used to pre-process the images from CBIS-DDSM is in this folder.
